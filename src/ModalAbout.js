			<p>Ticki is an easy to use and customizable Pomodoro Technique timer, developed with React.</p>

			<p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method created by Francesco Cirillo. It helps improving 
			productivity by taking short scheduled breaks regularly, and it can be used for any task.</p>

			<p>Decide the tasks you need to complete and put them on the to do list.
			Start the Pomodoro timer and work until the end of the pomdodoro. Take a short break (3-5 minutes)
			and tick the tasks you have completed. Another working pomodoro will follow. Every 4 Pomodoros take 
			a longer break, (15â€“30 minutes).</p>

			<p>Take a look at the setting section to customize timers length, theme and sound.</p>
